# Translation_Service_System
The Chaloem Phra Kiat Translation and Interpretation Center at Chulalongkorn University offers translation services in 14 languages. However, its inefficient data management—using paper notes and email—led to data loss and increased workload. To solve this, I and other 2 co-workers designed and implemented a database system to store key information such as translators, clients, and translation jobs, improving service efficiency, reducing errors, and streamlining data retrieval.
Here’s my job description for this project.
- Conduct user research, define requirements, and solve problems using design thinking
- Analyze and redesign system using data flow diagrams, ER diagrams, and data dictionaries
- Built mockup data and developed a PHP/SQL backend to facilitate tasks; work assignment and tracking monthly revenue
