# Translation_Service_System
The Chaloem Phra Kiat Translation and Interpretation Center at Chulalongkorn University offers translation services in 14 languages. However, its inefficient data management—using paper notes and email—led to data loss and increased workload. To solve this, I designed and implemented a database system to store key information such as translators, clients, and translation jobs, improving service efficiency, reducing errors, and streamlining data retrieval.
